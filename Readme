SPECIFICATION
This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the average shortest path in a graph. The graph can be generated using pseudo-random number generator to produce edges and their costs. 

USAGE
Run this simulator using the following commands:
    + make
    + ./simulator

REQUIREMENTS
    + linux
    + g++
    + c++11

STYLES
    Google C++ style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

REFERENCE
    Code structure and implementation is based on this beautiful code. https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/

WHAT I HAVE LEARNED
By doing this assignment, I have learnt a lot about C++, Dijkstra's algorithm. Specially,
    - how to implement Dijkstra's algorithm using priority queue
    - how to program priority queue using template in C++
    - how to seperate code in C++ between specification and implementations
    - how to use STL in C++
    - how to program OOP in C++
